<h1>About Us</h1> 

<font size="5"><p>         
 Islamic Burial Services Ltd (IBS) was established in 2015 to fulfil the role of the Burial Director to the Muslim Communities in Selangor. 
 There are sevaral burial services but there are only few which emphasis on the burial on muslim woman. <br> The services we provide will include all 
 the transportation for the deceased which will include the pick up of the janaza (deceased) from the home, hospital or mortuary, transport to the local 
 mosque or gusl facility, where the bathing (washing) and shrouding will be performed, and then the final transport to the local cemetery.</p>
<p>We will contact with the local council to book the grave site for burial and complete all the necessary paperwork and regulatory requirements including 
registration of the death with the appropriate government department.Our facilities are based on the nearest mosque of the deceased person, but you may choose 
to have the ghusl performed at any other place. We also pray that Allah (SWT) guides us to provide this essential service to the best of our ability within 
the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah for the benefit of the Muslim community.
</p>
<p>
Alhamdulillah, By the grace of Allah SWT we got some volenteers within our community who are giving 24 hours services online. May Allah (SWT) reward them for 
their valuable time and effort. To improve our service we highly appriciate your suggestions.<br>Although we try to accommodate different cultures, 
we arrange all funerals to be within Islamic practice rather than any ethnic or culture specific services. In trying to accommodate any request we will 
not be party to any act or practice outside of generally accepted Islamic principles.From the deceased family if anyone wants to perform gusl she will be 
highly encouraged. But relatives are not allowed to do any un-Islamic activities during the time of Janaza.
