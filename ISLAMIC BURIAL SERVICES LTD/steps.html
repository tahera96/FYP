<h1>BURIAL STEPS</h1>

 <b>WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WHEN A WOMAN PASSES AWAY?</b><br> 
<br> 
1 When a person passes away, his or her eyes should be closed immediately. <br> 
<br> 2.Tie a piece of cloth (material) from the chin to the head. This is to keep the mouth  
from remaining open. <br> 
<br> 
3 Cover  her with a sheet.<br> 
<br> 
Make preparations for the <em>Ghusl</em> (Bath), <em>Kaffan</em>, Burial order, <em>Janazah  
Salaah</em> and the actual burial. These acts for the deceased are all &quot;<em>Fard-i-Kifaayah</em>&quot;  
(A compulsory action which is to be performed by all, however if a few persons perform  
these duties, then the responsibility is waived off the others. If these are not carried  
out by anyone, then all responsible are sinners).<br> 
<br> 
All expenses for the deceased must be taken from the estate of the deceased. If the  
deceased did not have any such estate, then the responsibility is on his next of kin, eg.  
father, mother, sons, brothers, etc. If none of these relatives are available, or if they  
are too poor, then the expenses should come from the organisation responsible for the  
welfare of the community.   
<br> 
<br> 
The body of the deceased must be covered with a cloth (Sheet) before removing  her  
clothing. Those people who remove the clothes, must be careful not to allow the <em>Satr-i-Awrah</em>  
(parts that are Fard to be covered , and from the neck to ankles  
for women) to be uncovered. After this has been done, proceed with the <em>Ghusl</em> of  
the deceased. <br> 
<br> 
<b> IMPORTANT LAWS RELATING TO THE DECEASED.</b><br> <!DOCTYPE html>



<br> 
1. Where there is a shortage of water for some reason or the other, wash the entire body  
of the deceased at least once. <br> 
<br> 
2 When washing the back, the deceased should not be made to lie on the stomach, as this  
is prohibited. <br> 
<br> 
3. The <em>Niyyah</em> (Intention) for the <em>Ghusl</em> should be read. The <em>Niyyah</em>  
must be recited when the water is being poured on the head. <br> 

 The <i> Niyyah</i> for a female is:<br> 
<em>Nawaytu an aghsila Hadhihil mayyata <br> 
</em><br> 
&quot;I make <em>Niyyah</em> (intention) to bathe this deceased female&quot;<br> 
<br> 
4. Only  females are allowed to do ghusl for the female  deceased. However, If there is no female to give <em>Ghusl</em> to the deceased of a female, then the  
very same law will apply. If no close female relative or women is available, then her  husband, grandfather or brother may perform the <em>Ghusl</em>. If none of them are  available, then only <em>Tayammum</em> should be performed by a non-Mahram male. <br> 
&nbsp;<br> 
<b> THE <em>GHUSL</em> (BATH) FOR THE DECEASED</b><br> 
<br> 
NB: Prepare enough luke warm water for the <em>Ghusl</em>.<br> 
<br> 
1. The deceased must be made to lie on a raised platform in a closed room. <br> 
<br> 
2 The first aspect of <em>Ghusl</em> is to perform the <em>ISTINJA</em> (removal of all  
internal and external <em>Najaasat</em>). <br> 
<br> 

3 Now that the Istinja has been completed, WUDU (ablution) should be given to the  
deceased. First, make the <em>Niyah</em> then make the wudu: <br> 
<br>  The actual <em>Ghusl</em> is when water is poured over the entire body. Water should  
be poured starting from the head, then onto the entire front of the body, followed by the  
right back portion and then the left back portion. It must be remembered that all portions  
must be washed thrice (3 times). When complete <em>Ghusl</em> is performed, lastly throw camphor water on the entire  
body. <br> 
<br> 

<b>THE <em>KAFFAN</em> (SHROUD)</b><br> 
<br> 
After the <em>Ghusl</em> has been completed, the body is dried with a clean towel. The <em>Kaffan</em>  
is now put on. One single sheet covering the entire body will accomplish the Fard of the <em>Kaffan</em>  
(in certain circumstances or crisis eg. war, etc.) <br> 

<br> 
 The complete Sunnah <em>Kaffan</em> for the female consists of: <br> 
<br> 
 Kurta (which covers the lower half of body as well),<br> 
<br> 
 Head Gear (Awrni) which covers the head and extends over the breasts, and <br> 
<br> 
 Three full sheets covering the entire body. <br> 
<br> 
Note: Do not delay the<em> Salaatul Janazah</em> and Burial.<br> 
<br> 
&nbsp;<br> <b>
 THE METHOD OF PUTTING ON THE <em>KAFFAN</em><br></b> 
<br> 
1 It is desirable to use dried <em>lobaan</em> (powder), camphor and sandal in the <em>kaffan</em>.  
<br> 
<br> 
2 Likewise, <em>Ittar</em> can be put by means of cotton wool, but do not stain the <em>Kaffan</em>.  
<br> 
<br> 
3 Both the hands of the deceased should be left on its sides. 6.4 When putting on the <em>Kaffan</em>,  
the <em>Ghusl</em> platform (tray) should be dried and the <em>Izaar</em> should be put on  
while the deceased is on the <em>Ghusl</em> platform. <br> 
<br> 
5 After this, put two sheets on the floor and place the deceased on it. <br> 
<br> 
6 After placing the <em>Kaffan</em> on the two sheets, the <em>Kafni</em> should be put  
on, followed by the <em>Amaama</em> (Turban) or headgear for the female. <br> 
<br> 
7 When tying the <em>Kaffan</em>, the left of the sheet must be wrapped over to the  
right, and then the right of the sheet over to the left. <br> 
<br> 
8 After the <em>Kaffan</em> has been tied, three straps of cloth must be tied around the  
deceased. One strap above the head, the second around the waist and the third below the  
feet. When the deceased is placed in the grave, only two straps should be opened. The  
strap on the waist should not be released.<br> 
<br> 
<b>VISITING THE GRAVE<br> </b>
<br> 
It is Mustahab (desirable) for the men to visit the grave. It is sunnah to visit the  
graves of relatives especially the graves of one's parents, even though they be far away.  
It more excellent to visit the graves on Fridays. The manner and ethics of visiting the  
graves is that the person going to the graveyard should be in a state of <em>Taharah</em>  
(cleanliness). When proceeding towards the graveyard, one should be engrossed in <em>dhikr</em>  
and <em>Tilawah</em>. One should remove his shoes outside the graveyard. One should stand  
at the leg-side, and not the head-side of the grave. When entering the grave one should  
read the following: <br> 
<br> 
<em>As Salaamu Alaikum daara qaumim mu'mineena wa innaa Inshaa Allahu bikum laahiqoon.  
Nas'al-ullahu lana wa lakum ul-`aafiyata. Allahuma la tahrimnaa ajrahum wa laa taftinna  
ba'dahum waghfir lana wa lahum war-hamna ma`ahum.</em><br> 
<br> 
&quot;Peace be upon you, O dwellers of the grave, Group of&nbsp; believers and if Allah  
wins, then very soon we will unite with you. We pray to Almighty Allah for our and your  
harmony.&nbsp; O Allah do not deprive us from his reward and after him, do not test us and  
forgive all of us and all of them and with them, have Mercy on us&quot;. <br> 
<br> 
The person should then sit towards the face of the deceased, recite the verses of the  
Quran and make <em>D'ua-i-Maghfirah</em> with both hands lifted towards the sky. It is  
also permissible and a means of great <em>Thawaab</em> to make <em>Ziyaarah</em> to the  
graves of the Awliya Allah.<br>
